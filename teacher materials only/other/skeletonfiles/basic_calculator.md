Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

function squareNumber(num) {
    
}

squareNumber(3);

Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

function halfOf(num) {
    
}

halfOf(5);

Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

function percentOf(num1, num2) {
    
}

percentOf(5, 10);

Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."

function areaOfCircle(radius) {
    
}

areaOfCircle(2);


/***** BONUS QUESTION FOR THE KEEN STUDENTS *****/

Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
	Take half of the number and store the result.
	Square the result of #1 and store that result.
	Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
	Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).

function doCrazyStuff(num) {
   
}

doCrazyStuff(5);
