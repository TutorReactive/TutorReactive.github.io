Instructions:

Read the instructions for each exercise EXTREMELY carefully! Plan out how you want to solve the problems using a pen and piece of paper. Remember that if you are stuck, we are here to help you! 

When you think you have finished, call us over and we'll take a look :)
Remember, there are rewards for those who finish quickly! :)



The Age Calculator

Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateAge that:
takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.

HINT: Try confirming it with your own birth age and this year first!

function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear) {

}

// example calculateAge(1984, 2012) will output, "You are either 28 or 27"



The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of 100"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

HINT: How many days are there in a year?


function calculateSupply(age, numPerDay) {

}

// example calculateSupply(28, 1) will output, "You will need 26280 cups of tea until the ripe age of 100.""




The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

HINT: Can you guess what the values X, Y, Z and N are referred to?

function tellFortune(jobTitle, location, partner, numKids) {

}



The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

HINT: Remember your math formulas?

function calcGeometry(radius) {

}
