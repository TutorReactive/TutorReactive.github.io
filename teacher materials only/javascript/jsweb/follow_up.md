# GDI SF JS 200 Workshop Follow-Up

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO: TA names]** for being such great helpers. 

The slides are available at:
http://www.teaching-materials.org/jsweb/
We will always keep them available at that URL.

If you'd like to go farther, you can work through Khan Academy's [HTML/JS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js). Try the [Cat clicker Challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-js-dom-events/p/challenge-cat-clicker) (the first events challenge) and the [Solar System challenge](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-js-dom-modification/p/challenge-create-a-solar-system). 

Keep practicing exercises we did or coming up with new challenges for yourself.

Hope to see you at future workshops!
